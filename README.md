# Divas-Game

A JavaScript coding assignment.

## Overview

Diva-Game is a hangman-style game that was written as an exercise in JavaScript coding. The original specifications for the assigment called for selecting a word from an array, enabling the user a limited number of guesses, and keeping track of the guesses left within a round and the number of wins and losses the user racked up as the game progresses through the array of words. I've expanded it here in the following ways:

* A message board guides the user through the game.
* The user is not peanalized for guessing the same letter.
* The user does not lose a remaining guess if their selected letter is in the word.
* The user does not lose a remaining guess if they select a character that is not a letter (i.e. numbers and punctuations).
* The game has been themed to focus on female recording artists.
* For guessing an artist's name correctly, the user is rewarded with a music video of the artist on a "mainstage".

While the game could more easily be coded using JQuery, it was coded here using JavaScript as a personal learing exercise.

## Acknowledgments

This application was constructed as part of the University of Kansas Full-Stack Web-Development Coding Bootcamp Program offered in conjunction with Trinity Educational Services. Thanks to these institutions for providing the initial project requirements for a simple hangman-style game. Code studied in the course activities also served as a guide and provided helpful suggestions for building the application.
